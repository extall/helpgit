# helpgit
A complementary repository to https://github.com/extall/githelp that can be used to experiment with Git features.

Users taking the “git help” lectures are added to it as needed. This of course means that the administrator must add each user as a collaborator manually.

# Roll of Honor
You can add your (nick)name below, if you want to show that you have completed the lecture and exercise. Add it to the top of the list with the date. If multiple users complete the course in a single day, they are added to the row with their name sorted alphabetically.
